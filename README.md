### About
This is my final project for the last module of the Sogyo Academy. It's a text-based adventure game. A user can follow a certain path within the storyline and to get there, gets to solve puzzles and pick certain paths within the game.

Make your own choices during the corona pandemic. Will you hoard a lot of toilet paper or will you leave some for the poor elderly? 

Developed with Java 14.0.2.
Final Project for Sogyo.
